I (Michael) emailed the template to preble@electionsonthe.net on 03/09/2017 in the evening.
On 03/24/2017 I got the following email from Mickey Smith (Election Services Manager):

Good afternoon,

We will be sending the shape file under separate cover from our IT department.

The precincts boundaries are drawn for many reasons such as:
1. Keeping below the 1,400 active voter threshold set by the ORC
2. Census every 10 years
3. Keeping the splits in mind i.e. house districts, school districts, fire districts etc.

The last precinct change we had was in 2016 when we combined Milford 1 & 2 into Milford 1, name changed Milford 3.ecs & Milford 3.tcs to Milford2.ecs & Milford2.tcs, we did this because the original Milford 2 only had 141 voters.

Because of the various reasons precinct boundaries may change we can not notify each time they may occur.
