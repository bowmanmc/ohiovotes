# Warren County

## 2017-03-10
I (Michael) emailed the template on 03/09/2017 and got a response on
03/10/2017 asking me to fill out a pdf form and email back. I filled it
out, stating what information I needed, and sent it back on 03/10/2017.

Looks like Warren County has a GIS person on staff and has a lot of
GIS data available to the public such as property, subdivisions,
schools, hydrography, zoning, stop signs, traffic signals among others.

Followed up this morning and their GIS person didn't get the form I
submitted and emailed them. Filled out a new one and got the data
by lunch time.
