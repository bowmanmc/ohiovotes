# Preble County
I (Michael) emailed the template to preble@electionsonthe.net on 03/09/2017 in the evening. On 03/10/2017 I received this email from Terri Hans:

Michael,

Preble County doesn't have our precincts in GIS data form at this time.  We
will be working on that project this summer.  I am not sure how the
precincts were determined in the past.  We have combined precincts and they
are as follows:

2011 - Combined Lanier East & South to form Lanier Southeast - 1019 voters
            Moved Camden 3 voters into Camden 1 precinct - 733 voters

2011 - Combined West Elkton- Gratis SW & Gratis SE to form West Elkton;
Gratis   
             South - 1343 voters

Thank you,
Terri Hans
Director

After asking again for the data, I got the hand-drawn PDF in this directory.
According to Terri Hans, they will be working over the summer with an intern to
create GIS files for the precincts. They should be available in August 2017.
