# Warren County

I (Michael) emailed the template on 03/09/2017 and got a response on
03/10/2017 asking me to fill out a pdf form and email back. I filled it
out, stating what information I needed, and sent it back on 03/10/2017.

Looks like Warren County has a GIS person on staff and has a lot of
GIS data available to the public such as property, subdivisions,
schools, hydrography, zoning, stop signs, traffic signals among others.
