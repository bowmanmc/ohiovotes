Michael,

Preble County doesn't have our precincts in GIS data form at this time.  We
will be working on that project this summer.  I am not sure how the
precincts were determined in the past.  We have combined precincts and they
are as follows:

2011 - Combined Lanier East & South to form Lanier Southeast - 1019 voters
            Moved Camden 3 voters into Camden 1 precinct - 733 voters

2011 - Combined West Elkton- Gratis SW & Gratis SE to form West Elkton;
Gratis   
             South - 1343 voters

Thank you,
Terri Hans
Director
