Hello,

My name is Michael Bowman and I'm trying to get GIS data for the COUNTY_NAME County voting precints and the Ohio Secretary of State's office directed me to this email address. A shapefile would be perfect. In addition, I'd like some background information on how the precincts were determined, when they were last updated, and how I can be notified of changes to the precinct boundaries in the future.

Thank you so much for taking the time to gather this information together for me.

Sincerely,
Michael Bowman
