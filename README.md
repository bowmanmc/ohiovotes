Voting information for Ohio.

I contacted the Ohio Secretary of State's office on Open Data Day 2017 to request GIS data for voting 
precincts in Ohio. Their office replied back saying that each county was responsible for that data
and that I'd have to contact each of the 88 county board of elections offices individually! This is
a repo to gather and track the information I get.
