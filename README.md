Voting information for Ohio.

I contacted the Ohio Secretary of State's office on Open Data Day 2017 to request GIS data for voting
precincts in Ohio. Their office replied back saying that each county was responsible for that data
and that I'd have to contact each of the 88 county board of elections offices individually! This is
a repo to gather and track the information I get.


## Miscellaneous information
* Each county in Ohio has a board of elections office. They are responsible for
  handling the voting in their counties. The precincts are drawn by a four member
  board, consisting of two democrats and two republicans.
* Each precinct should have a maximum of 1,400 voters
* A polling location can take votes in for more than one precinct. Some rural
  precincts may not have any polling locations in them.
